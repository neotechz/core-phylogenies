# core-phylogenies
In a core genome, some genes may be more informative than others. Limiting the input to only those genes can potentially minimize the computational load of constructing phylogenomes. This repository aims to test that hypothesis using different ways of subsetting core genes.

This repository was created by the 'core-phylogenies' group (see Contributors) as part of the Philippine Genome Center - Bioinformatics Training and Internship Program 2025 (PGC-BTIP-2025) under the mentorship of Isaiah Lee, PhD and Franchesca Pascual.
